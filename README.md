# VSG Transportation Web App

## About This Project
This web app centralizes all the transportation options available to Vanderbilt students, including Lyft discount codes for school breaks, the campus shuttles (VandyRide), and Nashville public transportation.

The app will also include a feature for students to facilitate carpooling to the same location at the same date and time.

## About The Client
The main client for this project is Vanderbilt Student Government (VSG), a student organization that represents the Vanderbilt student body and communicates the interests of undergraduate students to university administration. More specifically, our specific client within the organization is the Student Services Committee, which initiated and runs the Vanderbilt-Lyft Partnership and manages the transportation information for Vanderbilt students.

## Technical Framework
We will use several programming languages, frameworks, and tools to develop and deploy the web application:
- Front end: React.js, CSS, HTML
- Back end: Python
- Database: SQL
- Server: Azure Web App Services
